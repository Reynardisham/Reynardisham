# Working notes

- Keep notes short, direct, and easy to return to.

- Focus on clarity over quantity in written thoughts.

- Use simple examples to explain reasoning.

- Keep drafts flexible and easy to reshape as needed.

- Begin with a clear question before exploring details.

- Use small drafts to test how ideas connect.

- Avoid polishing too early to maintain creativity.

- Track what assumptions were made during drafting.

- Revisit earlier drafts to find patterns and insights.

- Use simple examples to explain reasoning.

- Keep drafts flexible and easy to reshape as needed.
